# rusty-chat

A basic WebSocket library, tested with client-server frame passing.

Based on the tutorial found here: http://nbaksalyar.github.io/2015/07/10/writing-chat-in-rust.html

TODOs:
- Refactor into smaller modules (client, server, etc.)
- Flesh out into a lil functional chat app
- Work in Rust States instead of current state management solution
- Update to work with latest version of Mio
